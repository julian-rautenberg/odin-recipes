Recipes Project <br>
This is intended to be a small project to practice the application of what I've learned about HTML in TOP so far.
<ul>
  <li>Tags</li>
  <li>Links</li>
  <li>Images</li>
  <li>Lists</li>
</ul>

Looks horrible but was a basic success. Need to keep in mind to keep an eye out for backlinks and picture sizing.
